# Congrats, You're Autistic! A Neurodiversity-Affirming Online Toolkit

This project was developed with the goal of providing an alternative to the PDF toolkit currently offered by most medical providers following an autism diagnosis. With an understanding that Autistic adults are the foremost experts on what it means to have Autism, this project seeks to compile the best autistic-authored resources on the web and offer them in an easy-to-share format.

This project promotes viewing Autism through the lens of Neurodiversity and the social model of disability, which sees disability as a natural part of human diversity.

## Technologies and Features
This project was developed with JavaScript/JSX using React and relies heavily on the Reactstrap Card component. Each resource in the toolkit is contained on a card that houses the available features. These features are:

View Resource - opens the resource at its original source in a new window <br />
Share - provides links to share via messaging, email, facebook, or copying link <br />
Notes - allows logged in users to add notes to a resource <br />
Favorite - allows logged in users to add resource to a list of favorites. 

## Back-End/Server-Side
Currently the project is utilizing Redux for state management and asynchronous data pulled from a local json server. I'm currently working on integrating with an Express Server utilizing NodeJS and MongoDB to complete the functionality of the project. The server respository can be found here: https://github.com/erintustin/CYAServer

## Future Goals
A mobile app that allows users to build their own toolkit by added their own favorite resources from the web is currently in development. The repository can be found here: https://github.com/erintustin/CYA-React-Native  

I would like to expand this project to encompass other aspects of the Neurodivergent Spectrum ie ADHD, OCD, PTSD,  Tourette's, etc. with the overall goal of demystifying diagnosis and making it a more positive experience of understanding oneself and receiving the support one needs. 

## How to Contribute
I'm looking for assistance, especially from the Neurodivergent community, in selecting resources, testing accessiblity and design/user experience, as well as help developing the back-end to make this a fully-functioning web app. I have several medical providers interested in referring patients to this toolkit once completed. Please contact me at erintustin@gmail.com if you are interested in becoming a part of this project.
